    <h1>About Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h1>
    <p>Shivaji Maharaj, born in 1630, was a visionary Maratha warrior-king who established the Maratha Empire in the 17th century, known for his exceptional military prowess, strategic brilliance, and administrative acumen. Renowned for his guerrilla warfare tactics, Shivaji successfully resisted the mighty Mughal Empire's expansion, carving out an independent kingdom in the Deccan region of India. He was a champion of Hindu sovereignty, promoting religious tolerance and social justice within his realm. Shivaji's legacy endures as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and as a pioneer of Hindavi Swarajya (self-rule) in the face of colonial powers, influencing Indian nationalism for centuries to come.</p>

      <p>The Escape from Agra Fort: In one daring escapade, Shivaji, captured by the Mughals, devised a clever plan to escape from the Agra Fort
        . Disguised as a sadhu (holy man) and accompanied by his son Sambhaji, Shivaji was presented with trays of sweets as a gesture of hospitality. Seizing the opportunity, Shivaji and his son concealed small weapons within the sweets and managed to overpower the guards when they let their guard down. They then made their dramatic escape, scaling the walls of the fort under the cover of darkness, evading capture and returning to their kingdom..</p>
        <p>The Coronation on Raigad Fort: After establishing his kingdom, Shivaji was coronated as the Chhatrapati (emperor) atop the majestic Raigad Fort. Legend has it that during the ceremony, Shivaji spotted a small prick in his foot caused by a thorn. Instead of expressing any discomfort, Shivaji maintained his composure, demonstrating his unwavering determination and focus on his duties as a leader. This incident symbolizes Shivaji's resilience and dedication to his kingdom, even in the face of personal discomfort..</p>
          <p> In a famous confrontation with the powerful Adil Shahi general Afzal Khan, Shivaji displayed his tactical brilliance. Despite being outnumbered and facing a formidable opponent, Shivaji agreed to meet Afzal Khan in a one-on-one meeting. Knowing that Afzal Khan intended to assassinate him, Shivaji concealed a lethal weapon, the wagh nakh (tiger claws), within his hand. During the meeting, when Afzal Khan attempted to embrace him, Shivaji swiftly struck him with the concealed weapon, thwarting the assassination attempt and ensuring his own survival..</p>
